# Contact List App using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS

## Description
This is a Contact List application that fetches user data from the Random User API. It is searchable based on the first and last names.

## What, Why, and How
* What was your motivation? I wanted to learn tailwind css as well as review using react components, jsx, and props
* Why did you build this project? I am thinking about building my own contact list app, so this seemed like a good starting point
* What problem does it solve?
* What did you learn?
* What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here. The next step is to figure out how to build and connect a back end. I'd also like to add a form for users to input data.

## Features

## Issues/Challenges
* Challenges
    * Reviewing how to connect create react app to set it up to work with github pages
    * The api sometimes was slow to load, so my page would crash. Added in a line of code to handle this error.
